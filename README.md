# 100-Days-of-Code
Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! I am thrilled to share my 100-day journey with the Python course by Dr. Angela Yu. As a passionate learner, I am eager to delve deeper into the world of programming with Python and enhance my skills in this language.  
I have embarked on this journey to improve my proficiency in Python and discover its diverse applications in data science, machine learning, and web development. I believe that with the right guidance, effort, and dedication, anyone can master Python, and I am excited to be on this path.  
Dr. Angela Yu's course is renowned for its comprehensive and engaging approach to teaching Python. It covers an extensive range of topics, from the fundamentals of programming to advanced concepts such as web development, machine learning, and data visualization.  
In this repository, I will document my progress through this course, including my notes, code snippets, and projects. I will also share the challenges I face along the way, which I believe will serve as a reference for myself and inspire others starting their own Python journey.
